            <h3>Well, today I'm going to tell you a nice joke about my first trying with programming and writing code. 
                On 2018, I started my first trip with programming and codes , It was very silly trip. I started with 
                Unity Software to make games. I worked for long time , hours days months . And I did the impossible 
                to make it success. And finally , I finished and released it on Google Play Console for Android, 
                I paid more than 100$ to make it success . And during two years my income from this game is 2$. 
                It was very bad experience with programming , but I did not stop there , I have learned more about programming . 
                And now, I'm a member in a scholarship for programming and design WebPages in full stack at LTUC .

            </h3>
